  headings now proper level in settings for body, which was necessary to

  [davisagli]


2.1.1 (2012-10-05)

  [davisagli]

2.0.3 - 2010-11-24

* PEP8 adjustments for the safe_html transform.
  [hannosch]

2.0 - 2010-07-16

  [stefan]

  [hannosch]

  [jonstahl]

2.0a1 - 2009-11-13

  [hannosch]

  col, and colgroup tags by default, since they are harmless, valid XHTML

  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6712 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7251
  [limi]

* Added proper Z3 interfaces and added direct implements statements instead
  of applying the changes later on with zcml. Reduced number of zcml files
  to one.

  as we have it, i keep it and next release number in the cycle needed for
  Archetypes 1.4.2 (used for Plone 2.5.2) of PortalTransforms is then the 1.5
  final.

1.5.0-final - 2006-12-15
------------------------

1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25

  with the same functionality. Migration is handled on reinstall.
  http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4538
  [csenger] [dreamcatcher]

  thread) and I've never heard of problem caused by this
  omission.
  [sidnei]

* Fix a long outstanding issue with improper COM thread model

  inside the mapping.
  [dreamcatcher]

  [dreamcatcher]

* Add a html filter to extract the content of the body tag (so we don't get a
