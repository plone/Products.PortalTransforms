Changelog
=========

------------------

* Let mimetype maps with empty transform lists be handled more gracefully.

  different virtual host.
  [rossp]

1.6.8 - 2010-02-19

------------------------

1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25

  in CMFPlone just zero for non-int-castable values.
  [jensens]

  [csenger] [dreamcatcher]

  omission.
  [sidnei]
