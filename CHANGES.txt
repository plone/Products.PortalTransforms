  [davisagli]


2.1.1 (2012-10-05)

  [davisagli]

2.0.5 - 2011-02-26
------------------

- Fix regression due to the security declarations added in 2.0.4: convertTo
  should still be public, but not publishable.
  [davisagli]

2.0.4 - 2011-02-25
------------------

- Fix missing security declarations.
  [davisagli]

2.0.3 - 2010-11-24

------------------

* Close ``<p>`` tags properly in ``configureTransform.zpt``.
  [swampmonkey]

* Add HTML5 tags as valid: `article`, `aside`, `audio`, `canvas`, `command`,
  `datalist`, `details`, `figcaption`, `figure`, `footer`, `header`, `hgroup`,
  `keygen`, `mark`, `rp`, `rt`, `ruby`, `section`, `source`, `summary`,

  [limi]

  [hannosch]

* PEP8 adjustments for the safe_html transform.
  [hannosch]

2.0 - 2010-07-16

  [hannosch]

2.0b6 - 2010-06-13

  different virtual host.
  [rossp]

2.0b4 - 2010-03-01

------------------

  [hannosch]

  [limi]

  [jonstahl]

2.0a1 - 2009-11-13

  [hannosch]

* Removed useless assert statements.
  [hannosch]

* Structured Text is gone in Zope 2.12.
  [hannosch]

  installed. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8285.

  [hannosch]

* Allowed the abbr, acronym, var, dfn, samp, address, bdo, thead, tfoot,
  col, and colgroup tags by default, since they are harmless, valid XHTML
  and shouldn't be filtered. Fixes:
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6712 and
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7251
  [limi]

* Added proper Z3 interfaces and added direct implements statements instead

  as we have it, i keep it and next release number in the cycle needed for
  Archetypes 1.4.2 (used for Plone 2.5.2) of PortalTransforms is then the 1.5
  final.

1.5.0-final - 2006-12-15
------------------------

1.5.0-a1 - 2006-10-25

  thread) and I've never heard of problem caused by this
  omission.
  [sidnei]

  inside the mapping.
  [dreamcatcher]
